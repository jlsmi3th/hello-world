        The Radisson
        at
        500 Leisure Lane Sacramento, CA 95815
        is our venue for this year's reunion
        on September 25 and 26.
        For complete information see the "Reunion Info" page,
        link to the left.
        As you can see,
        our website now stands alone
        and no longer has to lurk within my personal website.
        This may make it easier for the various search engines to find
        and, therefore, may improve our chances of classmates
        finding the site and attending the event.

        A new FaceBook group,
        <br>
        <b>San Juan High School Class of 1965, Citrus Heights CA</b>
        <br>
        has been created as a closed group
        for our classmates and friends of the class of '65.
        This means the group is visible to all
        but only members may make posts.
        I started with my personal list of FaceBook friends as the starter nucleus
        of the membership roster.
        Any member may add new members so I hope this FB group will grow rapidly
        and become a lively adjunct to this website.

<h2>
  It doesn’t seem possible that it’s almost time for our 55th Reunion!
</h2>
<p>
  This reunion is shaping up
  to be an evening event,
  to distinguish it from our annual <i>lunch</i> reunions,
  tentatively be held
  sometime in September 2020.
</p>
<p>
  We’re looking into having it somewhere in Folsom.
  Maybe Natomas Inn?
  It’s a great location
  and walking distance to so many things to do
  in Old Town Folsom.
  Those who stayed at the recommended hotel last time said
  the next morning breakfast provided
  another great opportunity to socialize.
</p>
<p>
  As for the event,
  we’re thinking of a casual evening with hors d'oeuvres
  that would encourage people to be more mobile for visiting
  than just sitting at tables and being served.
  We’re also considering having a DJ
  for dancing or background entertainment.
</p>
<p>
    At this point we have not decided
    on a price or single contact person.
    Your questions and comments may be directed
    to those noted on the
    <a href="contact.php">"Contact Us"</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  Please to spread the word
  to your Spartan friends!
</p>
<hr>
      <p>
        Please contact those classmates with whom you have kept in touch
        to bring this website to their attention and
        to give us their latest contact information
        so we can apprise them of future events.
      </p>
